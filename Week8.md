# Banking Union (Week 8)
*Reading in textbook - Chapter 14: "Banking in the EU" pp 461-474.*

$$Equation = 1^{2} \times \beta_{t}$$

**Group 11: Question:** Will the resolution funds be large enough?

**Main Questions**
* What is banking union?
* Why is it needed?
* Will it work?
* What would a full banking union look like?

## Introduction & Single Rulebook

### Single Rulebook
Working towards a **single standard** (as opposited to 'minimum stardard') e.g the standard for an accountant in the EU.

Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD4)
* Trying the reduce differences between different partners' country's rulebooks.

Regulations
* The amount of capital hold by banks 
* Regulation of liquidity of banks

## Single supervisory mechanism SSM
**What is it?**
* Headed by the European Central Bank
* Has responsibility for supervising banks in the Euro Area.
* Created under Article 127 (6), of the Treaty on the Funcitoning of the European Union (TFEU). They used this because it would be very hard to get everyone to agree on a new treaty. 
* Supervises 130 largest banks and all cross-border banks. (85% banking assets) - UK is excluded.

## Bank Resolution & Single Resolution Mechanism
Useful to have someone at the EU level to tell those at the national level what to do, rather than them trying to work together, which could have problems with asymetric information and/or secrecy.

### The Bank recovery and resolution directive
Applies to whole EU/EEA. Helps to make sure the taxpayers aren't forced to bail out banks.

**Recovery**
* Bank can recover without intervention.

**Resolution:**
* Authorities are responsible.
* Authorities replace the management of the bank (appoint a manager to take control the bank)
	* Special manager could divide the bank up into functional and non-functional parts
	* Sell the bank or parts of it to somebody else.
	* Must be done overnight/over the weekend
	* Transfer operation of the bank to a 'bridge bank' (max 1-2 years of opperation)
* **Bail-in**:
	* The bank's creditor bear losses.
	* Value of bank's asses is < its liabilities.
	* To return to solvency, the bank's asset must increase or liabilities must decrease. (or combo of both).
	* The bail-in **tool**: runs down a bank's liabilities in one of two ways.
		1. Write the liabilities down in order of priority.
		2. Swap debt for equity.
	* All this costs money:
		* Resolution funds worth 1% of covered deposits in the EU are available.
* Two remaining elements:
	* Recovery and resolution plans
	* Depositor preference
		1. Shareholders
		2. Subordinated debt-holders
		3. Junior unsecured debt-holders (in NZ, depositors sit here)
		4. Senior unsecured debt-holders
		5. (In EU depositors sit here, in last place).		

### Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) run by Single Resolution Board (SRB)
* Covers euro area, and all others that join the SSM.
* Works with national resolution autorities.

**Single resolution fund**
* Funds are mutualised, (between 2016-2024).
* Amount to 1% of the covered deposits or â‚¬55 billion.
